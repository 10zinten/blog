    "To understand what Unicode is, first we need to understand basic encoding scheme called [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). Essentially *ASSCII* encodes every character in 7-bits, that means it can represent only 128 possible set of characters. Unicode is just a massive version of the ASCII table, which can represent 1,114,112 possible characters. In fact first 128 characters of Unicode table correspong precisely to the ASCII characters. That makes Unicode backward compatible to ASCII. For more detail description of Unicode follow this [link](http://www.unicode.org/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "But remember that Unicode is not an encoding scheme, it's just a collection of code points representing characters and symbols. Unicode has various encoding sheme like `UTF-8` (most commonly used), `UTF-16` and `UTF-32` are used for representing Unicode characterss as binary data."

So here comes `UFT-16` which represent every character in 2 bytes and if code point is larger than that we need have `UTF-32` wich represent every character in 4 bytes.\n",
